## Features

Draftail aims for a mouse-free, keyboard-centric experience. Here are important features worth highlighting:

- Support for [keyboard shortcuts](https://www.draftail.org/docs/keyboard-shortcuts). Lots of them!
- Paste from Word. Or any other editor. It just works.
- Autolists – start a line with `-` , `*` , `1.` to create a list item.
- Shortcuts for heading levels `##`, code blocks ` ``` `, text formats `**`, and more.
- Undo / redo – until the end of times.
- Common text types: headings, paragraphs, quotes, lists.
- Common text styles: Bold, italic, and many more.
- API to build custom controls for links, images, and more.
- Compatibility with the [`draft-js-plugins`](https://www.draft-js-plugins.com) ecosystem to build more advanced extensions.
